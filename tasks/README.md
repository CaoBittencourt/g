# Task Lists and Planning
Our task management here is radically minimalistic. There are only two files and no external software is used:

|File       |Description                                                        |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`agile.txt`|Keeps track of the (general) project direction (i.e. version goals)|
|`jira.txt` |List of all non-trivial tasks (trivial tasks should not be listed) |

In both files, we adopt a simple convention and mark tasks as
- `[ ]`: not started;
- `[*]`: in progress (current task);
- `[\]`: in progress (not current task);
- `[x]`: finished.

Try to (roughly) order tasks by importance. No need for elaborate metrics or due dates. Finished tasks go to the bottom of the task list.
